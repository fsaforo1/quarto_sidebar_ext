After months of trial and error, I've finally developed a sourdough recipe that consistently produces the perfect loaf. Here's my process and what I've learned along the way.

## The Secret is in the Starter

A healthy starter is the foundation of great sourdough. I've been maintaining mine (named "Bubbles") for over six months now.

The key to a vibrant starter is regular feedings and consistency in temperature. I keep mine in a warm spot in the kitchen, usually around 75°F (24°C). Every morning, I discard all but 50g and feed it with equal parts flour and water.

## My Reliable Recipe

Below is my go-to recipe that works every time:

| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Bread flour | 400g |
| Whole wheat flour | 100g |
| Water | 350g |
| Active starter | 100g |
| Salt | 10g |

## Temperature Matters

I've found that controlling fermentation temperature is crucial for predictable results. Here's what I've observed:

- Cold kitchen (below 68°F): expect 5-6 hours for bulk fermentation
- Moderate temperature (70-75°F): about 4 hours
- Warm kitchen (above 78°F): as little as 3 hours

Adjusting your timeline based on your kitchen temperature will help achieve consistent results every time.

## Next Baking Project

I'm excited to experiment with ancient grains next month. My shopping list includes:

- Einkorn flour
- Spelt berries
- Emmer flour

Stay tuned for more adventures in sourdough baking!
