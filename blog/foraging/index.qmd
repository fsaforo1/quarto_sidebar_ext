# Urban Foraging Adventures

Last weekend marked my third year of urban foraging—finding edible plants, fruits, and fungi in city spaces. What began as a pandemic hobby has evolved into a passionate pursuit that connects me to my urban environment in surprising ways.

## The Unexpected City Bounty

Many people assume nothing edible grows in cities beyond community gardens, but they'd be amazed at what thrives in our urban landscapes:

- Mulberry trees lining city streets
- Wild garlic in neglected park corners
- Dandelions in vacant lots (entirely edible from root to flower)
- Purslane creeping through sidewalk cracks
- Oyster mushrooms on dead street trees after rainfall

## Seasonal City Calendar

### Spring Findings
The city awakens with tender greens after winter—garlic mustard appears in shady areas, offering a peppery kick to salads. Violets bloom in surprising numbers, their flowers making beautiful cake decorations.

### Summer Abundance
Mulberries stain sidewalks purple in June, while blackberry patches flourish along railway edges. I've mapped seventeen public fruit trees within walking distance of my apartment!

### Fall Treasures
Autumn brings nuts—black walnuts from park trees and occasional chestnuts. Urban apple trees, descendants of discarded cores, offer tart fruits perfect for cider.

## Ethics and Safety

I follow three cardinal rules:

1. **Know before you pick** - 100% identification certainty
2. **Test before you feast** - Small samples first, waiting 24 hours
3. **Share but don't deplete** - Never take more than 10% of a stand

## Community Connections

My foraging has introduced me to a diverse community of urban naturalists:

| Name | Specialty | Favorite Finding Spot |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| Eliza | Medicinal plants | Cemetery edges |
| Jamal | Wild mushrooms | Woodchip areas |
| Susan | Forgotten fruit trees | Old neighborhoods |

Next week, we're hosting our first "Found Food Feast" where everything served will be foraged within city limits. I'm preparing mulberry jam, dandelion wine, and mushroom pâté.

Who knew the city could be so delicious?
